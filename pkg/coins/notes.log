XSN:
- maybe ask for unified naming for the "transactions" attribute in json for `Block`

GRPH:
- IP request limit (40s wait seems fine)
- decrypt for GetTransactionById does not do anything


MC:
- getrawtransaction?decrypt=1&txId=407d3c8c0c1cecadc9dc50626ef0aef70159278283a46590287599e9d8b9b0bd works not
- txId=407d3c8c0c1cecadc9dc50626ef0aef70159278283a46590287599e9d8b9b0bd&decrypt=1& works ??
